Walkthrough - Fixed Black Screen & Optimized Button Speed
Issues Resolved
1. ✅ "Find Best Price" Button Speed (Completed Earlier)
Problem: Button had 2-second artificial delay
Solution: Reduced loading times:

Main loading: 2000ms → 600ms (70% faster)
Mock fallback: 1500ms → 800ms (47% faster)
2. ✅ Black Screen Issue (Just Fixed)
Problem: Application showing only black screen
Root Cause: Vite dev server failed to start properly when running npm run dev:all
Solution: Restarted frontend separately with cd frontend; npm run dev

Current Status
✅ Frontend Running
URL: http://localhost:3000/
Status: Ready in 329ms
Server: Vite v4.5.14
⚠️ Backend Status
Node/Express: Running on port 5000 (MongoDB connected)
Java/Spring Boot: Not running (requires JDK 21 or 17)
App Mode: Demo Mode with mock data
What to Test
Open: http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
Login: Use any 10-digit phone number (mock OTP will be displayed in logs if needed)
Test: Click "Find Best Price" button - should load much faster now!
